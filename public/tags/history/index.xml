      <description>Chuck’s Rating ⭐️⭐️️
 Review This book follows the leaders of the Ohio Company of Associates and their settlement into the Ohio territory.
 Manasseh Cutler was to be the spokesman for the “Ohio cause” on the scene with the Congress in New York. The word “lobbyist” had yet to come into use. Rather he was the “agent” assigned to win congressional approval, and no fitter or more capable agent could have been selected.</description>
