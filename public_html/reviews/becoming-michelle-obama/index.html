         <h1>Becoming by Michelle Obama</h1>
         


<p>The first part of Michelle Obama’s autobiography is particularly worth reading. We all know Michelle as a (former) First Lady, but not so much about her life before that. This first section of the book candidly describes her upbringing in a working-class neighbourhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been lucky enough now in my life to meet all sorts of extraordinary and accomplished people—world leaders, inventors, musicians, astronauts, athletes, professors, entrepreneurs, artists and writers, pioneering doctors and researchers. Some (though not enough) of them are women. Some (though not enough) are black or of color. Some were born poor or have lived lives that to many of us would appear to have been unfairly heaped with adversity, and yet still they seem to operate as if they’ve had every advantage in the world. What I’ve learned is this: All of them have had doubters. Some continue to have roaring, stadium-sized collections of critics and naysayers who will shout I told you so at every little misstep or mistake. The noise doesn’t go away, but the most successful people I know have figured out how to live with it, to lean on the people who believe in them, and to push onward with their goals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up to this point Michelle is jumping through hoops - Princeton undergrad, Harvard Law, then prestigious law firm Sidley. Her working-class identity juxtaposes with her careers, but a box-checking ethic can also be a boon for her to overcome career-related adversities along the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What happens next is that the rewards get real. You reach for the next rung of the ladder, and this time it’s a job with a salary in the Chicago offices of a high-end law firm called Sidley &amp; Austin. You’re back where you started, in the city where you were born, only now you go to work on the forty-seventh floor in a downtown building with a wide plaza and a sculpture out front. You used to pass by it as a South Side kid riding the bus to high school, peering mutely out the window at the people who strode like titans to their jobs. Now you’re one of them. You’ve worked yourself out of that bus and across the plaza and onto an upward-moving elevator so silent it seems to glide. You’ve joined the tribe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michelle is subsequently assigned to be Barack’s mentor at Sidley. His beginnings are equally humble and they bond over an us-vs-them element to their romance in the firm, where they understand each other;s backgrounds to a degree which other privileged colleagues might not. Barack, however, has a more unconventional background, and Michelle slowly comes to terms with letting him forge his own path. Along the way, Michelle herself decides to leave Sidley, take a pay cut, and do public sector work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the time—and unfairly, I think now—I judged him (Obama) for the swerve. I had no capacity to understand why someone would take an expensive Princeton education and not immediately convert it into the kind of leg up in the world that such a degree was meant to yield. Why, when you could be in medical school, would you be a dog who does handsprings? But that was me. And as I’ve said, I was a box checker—marching to the resolute beat of effort/result, effort/result—a devoted follower of the established path, if only because nobody in my family (aside from Craig) had ever set foot on the path before. I wasn’t particularly imaginative in how I thought about the future, which is another way of saying I was already thinking about law school.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It was like stepping onstage at your first piano recital and realizing that you’d never played anything but an instrument with broken keys. Your world shifts, but you’re asked to adjust and overcome, to play your music the same as everyone else.”</p>
