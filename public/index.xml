      <description>Chuck’s Rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 Review The first part of Michelle Obama’s autobiography is particularly worth reading. We all know Michelle as a (former) First Lady, but not so much about her life before that. This first section of the book candidly describes her upbringing in a working class neighbourhood.
 “I’ve been lucky enough now in my life to meet all sorts of extraordinary and accomplished people—world leaders, inventors, musicians, astronauts, athletes, professors, entrepreneurs, artists and writers, pioneering doctors and researchers.</description>

 Review This book describes various therapy sessions as seen through the eyes of a practitioner. Lori’s train-of-thought, running commentary about her conversations with patients provides colour into their lived experiences and makes us empathise with their struggles. She interweaves into the storyline her own experiences and her own conversations with her therapist, creating a rich, autobiographical tapestry which reminds us how emotionally frail each of us can be.</description>

Wisdom  Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.
— Anne Lamott. “Almost Everything”.
  The part I like most about Luke’s story is the lawyer who tries to trap Jesus with a trick question about who his neighbor is, so he can find a loophole in Jesus’ appeal to love thy neighbor.</description>

 Review This book follows the leaders of the Ohio Company of Associates and their settlement into the Ohio territory.
 Manasseh Cutler was to be the spokesman for the “Ohio cause” on the scene with the Congress in New York. The word “lobbyist” had yet to come into use. Rather he was the “agent” assigned to win congressional approval, and no fitter or more capable agent could have been selected.</description>
