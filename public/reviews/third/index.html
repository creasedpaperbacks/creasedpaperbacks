<h1>Review</h1>
<p>This book follows the leaders of the Ohio Company of Associates and their settlement into the Ohio territory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manasseh Cutler was to be the spokesman for the “Ohio cause” on the scene with the Congress in New York. The word “lobbyist” had yet to come into use. Rather he was the “agent” assigned to win congressional approval, and no fitter or more capable agent could have been selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conspicuous loafing, loafing of almost any kind was as yet unknown. Everyone worked, including children. It had to be so for survival. Come spring there were crops to be sown. Through summer and into fall, there were crops to be harvested, and always more land needed to be cleared. Winter was a struggle in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are first introduced to the character of Manasseh Cuter and how he navigates between congressional negotiations for the purchase of land, to dealing with survival against the elements and native Indians. Settling is hardship, and the book conveys the struggle of settling whilst alluding to themes of Manifest Destiny and the inevitability of conquering against all odds.</p>

<h1>Vignette</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, too, notably, Blennerhassett was not always sensible about how he spent his money, and thus was easily duped by some of the locals known for dishonesty. In the days before limestone quarries were opened, river clamshells were calcined on log fires and used to plaster rooms. In bargaining with one noted cheat, Blennerhassett was told that collecting the shells was a difficult task, in that it was necessary to dive into water six or eight feet deep, and therefore the charge was 50 cents a bushel, when in truth any quantity of shells could be found in water only inches deep. Blennerhassett paid five times what the shells were worth.</p>
