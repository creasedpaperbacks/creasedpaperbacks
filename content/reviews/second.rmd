⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

# Review 

This book describes various therapy sessions as seen through the eyes of a practitioner. Lori’s train-of-thought, running commentary about her conversations with patients provides colour into their lived experiences and makes us empathise with their struggles. She interweaves into the storyline her own experiences and her own conversations with her therapist, creating a rich, autobiographical tapestry which reminds us how emotionally frail each of us can be. 

# Quotes

>We talk to ourselves more than we’ll talk to any other person over the course of our lives but our words aren’t always kind or true or helpful—or even respectful. Most of what we say to ourselves we’d never say to people we love or care about, like our friends or children. In therapy, we learn to pay close attention to those voices in our heads so that we can learn a better way to communicate with ourselves.

>In movies, therapist silences have become a cliché, but it’s only in silence that people can truly hear themselves. Talking can keep people in their heads and safely away from their emotions. Being silent is like emptying the trash. When you stop tossing junk into the void—words, words, and more words—something important rises to the surface. And when the silence is a shared experience, it can be a gold mine for thoughts and feelings that the patient didn’t even know existed. Great joy is sometimes best expressed through silence, as when a patient comes in after landing a hard-won promotion or getting engaged and can’t find the words to express the magnitude of what she’s feeling. So we sit in silence together, beaming.

# Beautiful Writing 

>Frankl’s book: “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”
